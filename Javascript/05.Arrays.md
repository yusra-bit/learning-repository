# Arrays

- Objects allow you to store keyed collections of values.
- But quite often we find that we need an ordered collection, where we have a 1st, a 2nd, a 3rd element and so on.
- It is not convenient to use an object here, because it provides no methods to manage the order of elements. We can’t insert a new property “between” the existing ones. Objects are just not meant for such use.
- There exists a special data structure named ***Array***, to store ordered collections.



## Declaration
📌 There are two syntaxes for creating an empty array:
 ```
 let arr = new Array();
let arr = [];
 ```
 📌 Almost all the time, the second syntax is used. We can supply initial elements in the brackets:

```
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Plum"];
```

📌Array elements are numbered, starting with zero.We can get an element by its number in square brackets:

```
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Plum"];

alert( fruits[0] ); // Apple
alert( fruits[1] ); // Orange
alert( fruits[2] ); // Plum
```
📌 We can replace an element:
```
fruits[2] = 'Pear'; // now ["Apple", "Orange", "Pear"]
```
📌 …Or add a new one to the array:
```
fruits[3] = 'Lemon'; // now ["Apple", "Orange", "Pear", "Lemon"]
```
📌 The total count of the elements in the array is its length:

```
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Plum"];

alert( fruits.length ); // 3
```

📌 We can also use alert to show the whole array.

```
let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Plum"];

alert( fruits ); // Apple,Orange,Plum
```
