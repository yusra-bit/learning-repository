# 🗝️ Primitive & Reference Types
 ✅ ***primitive data types*** represent the simplest and most basic building blocks of data. 

 ✅ ***reference data types*** are more complex. They are used to store and manipulate collections of data or objects with multiple properties and methods.
 
Unlike primitives, reference data types are mutable, meaning their contents can be changed after they are created.

**📎Primitive type**
```let numOne = 50;
let numTwo = numOne; //numTwo=numOne=50
numOne = 100;
console.log(numOne); //outputs 100
console.log(numTwo); //outputs 50
```

**Reference type**
```let object1 = {
name:'Bingeh',
age:18
};
let object2 = object1;

//updating object1,
object1.age = 20;

console.log(object2); //we see that object2 also updates the age attribute
```

**💡 some refrence data types in Javascript:**
1. Objects: Objects are versatile and widely used in JavaScript. They are collections of key-value pairs, where keys are strings 
2. Arrays: Arrays are ordered collections of values, indexed by integers.
3. Functions: Functions are used for encapsulating reusable code and implementing logic in JavaScript programs.
4. Date: he Date object represents date and time information
