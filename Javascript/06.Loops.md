# Javascript For Loop

- Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.

#### Example 

Instead of writing 
```text += cars[0] + "<br>";
text += cars[1] + "<br>";
text += cars[2] + "<br>";
text += cars[3] + "<br>";
text += cars[4] + "<br>";
text += cars[5] + "<br>";
```

You can write:
```
for (let i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
  text += cars[i] + "<br>";
}
```

### Different Kinds of Loops
JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

1. `for `- loops through a block of code a number of times
2. `for/in` - loops through the properties of an object
3. `for/of` - loops through the values of an iterable object
4. `while` - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
5. `do/while` - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

#### üìö The For Loop
The for statement creates a loop with 3 optional expressions:
```
for (expression 1; expression 2; expression 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```
**Expression 1** is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

**Expression 2** defines the condition for executing the code block.

**Expression 3** is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.


#### üìö The For In Loop
#### Syntax
```
for (key in object) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```
#### Example
```
const person = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25};

let text = "";
for (let x in person) {
  text += person[x];
}
```
#### üìö The For In Over Arrays
üö´ Do not use for in over an Array if the index order is important.
#### Syntax
```
for (variable in array) {
  code
}
```
#### Example
```
const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];

let txt = "";
for (let x in numbers) {
  txt += numbers[x];
}
```

#### üìö The For Of Loop
‚úÖ The JavaScript for of statement loops through the values of an iterable object.

‚úÖ It lets you loop over iterable data structures such as Arrays, Strings, Maps, NodeLists, and more:

#### Syntax
```
for (variable of iterable) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```
- **variable** - For every iteration the value of the next property is assigned to the variable. Variable can be declared with const, let, or var.

- **iterable** - An object that has iterable properties.

#### üìö Looping over an Array

##### Example
```
const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Mini"];

let text = "";
for (let x of cars) {
  text += x;
}
```

#### üìö The While Loop
This loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

#### Syntax
```
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

##### Example
```
while (i < 10) {
  text += "The number is " + i;
  i++;
}
```

#### üìö The Do While Loop
This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.

#### Syntax
```
do {
  // code block to be executed
}
while (condition);
```

##### Example
```
do {
  text += "The number is " + i;
  i++;
}
while (i < 10);
```

### ü™ì Break Statement 
- The break statement "jumps out" of a loop.

#### Example
```
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === 3) { break; }
  text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
}
```

### üîÅ Continue Statement
- The continue statement "jumps over" one iteration in the loop.

#### Example
```
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === 3) { continue; }
  text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
}
```
