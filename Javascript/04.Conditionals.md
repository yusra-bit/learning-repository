# Conditional Statements

Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

**ðŸ’¡ In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:**

1. ``if`` to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
2. ``else`` to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
3. ``else if`` to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
4. ``switch`` to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

### The if Statement
- Use the `if` statement to specify a block of JavaScript code to be executed if a condition is true.
 - ðŸš« if is in lowercase letters. Uppercase letters (If or IF) will generate a JavaScript error.

 #### Example 
 âœ… Make a "Good day" greeting if the hour is less than 18:00:


```
if (hour < 18) {
  greeting = "Good day";
}
```


### The else Statement
- Use the `else` statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.
 

 #### Example 
âœ… If the hour is less than 18, create a "Good day" greeting, otherwise "Good evening":
```
if (hour < 18) {
  greeting = "Good day";
} else {
  greeting = "Good evening";
}
```

### The else if Statement
- Use the `else if` statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false
 

 #### Example 
âœ… If time is less than 10:00, create a "Good morning" greeting, if not, but time is less than 20:00, create a "Good day" greeting, otherwise a "Good evening":
```
if (hour < 18) {
  greeting = "Good day";
} else {
  greeting = "Good evening";
} else {
  greeting = "Good evening";
}
```
