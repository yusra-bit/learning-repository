# JavaScript Functions

- Function is a block of code designed to perfrom task.

- A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

**🚀 Why Functions?**
1. With functions you can reuse code

2. You can write code that can be used many times.

3. You can use the same code with different arguments, to produce different results.

#### Syntax
- Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

```
function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed
}
```

### 🛤️ Function Invocation
The code inside the function will execute when "something" **invokes** (calls) the function:

- When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
- When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
- Automatically (self invoked)

### 🛤️ Function Return 
✨ When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.

✨ If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.

✨Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller":

#### 💻 Example
🧮 Calculate the product of two numbers, and return the result:


```
// Function is called, the return value will end up in x
let x = myFunction(4, 3);

function myFunction(a, b) {
// Function returns the product of a and b
  return a * b;
}
```
