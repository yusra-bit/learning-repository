## üìù  Introduction
 ‚úÖ JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). 

 ‚úÖ JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
 - Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. 

 - Server-side JavaScript  extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
