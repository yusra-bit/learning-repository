## 📐 Variable
- Variables are Containers for Storing Data.
### ⌛ History 
- The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

- The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

- The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers.

**💭 JavaScript Variables can be declared in 3 ways:**
1. `` var``
2.  `` let``
3.  ``const`` - These are constant values and cannot be changed.

**💡 When to Use var, let, or const?**
1. Always declare variables

2. Always use ***const*** if the value should not be changed

3. Always use ***const*** if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)

4. Only use ***let*** if you can't use ***const***

5. Only use ***var*** if you MUST support old browsers.

#### 🔮 The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are 🔮:

- Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
- Names must begin with a letter.
- Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
- Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
- Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
#### 📟  Examples
```
let user = 'John';
let age = 25;
let message = 'Hello';
```

```
let message;
message = 'Hello!';
message = 'World!'; // value changed
alert(message);
```
